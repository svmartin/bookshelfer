add files for each component:
*book: where we will iterate over each book
**Shelf: one of 3 shelves, which will hold 0-many books
***Shelves: will hold the 3 bookshelves (each shelf will have a title/section)
***Search: will allow user to search for books AND add/remove/change book location
****Main App: will hold the Shelves component and route to either Shelves or search

### ChangeShelf (drop-down component with 4 options: )
### OpenSearch (component that is accessible from "main" page...when clicked, brings user to search)
### index.js (add react-router and wrap main App component in router) AND grab DIV: root
